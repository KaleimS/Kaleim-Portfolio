## Description
- My aim for this project was to create a responsive Portfolio to satisfy the needs of people who may be viewing my Portfolio on a mobile or tablet, not just desktop size.
  While creating this project I used the power of google to help me with media queries and css grid, it definitly helped gain further knowledge on those topics. This project was a my first responsive webpage, and was a chance to push myself to see what I could do with what I understand of CSS and HTML, I'm ready to see the improvement in my next project.
